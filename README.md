# — Check My Attendance —

This repository uses the [`gh-pages`][gh-pages] `npm` package to build and deploy a React application. See a live, interactive version of the website [here][live-website].

## Getting Started: Contributing

### 1. Clone the repository

1. Navigate to the desired directory where the project will be stored.

1. Clone the repository by executing the following command.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diegobajetti/check-my-attendance.git
   ```

### 2. Install the required dependencies

1. Install the required dependencies by executing the following command.

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

   > It is assumed that `npm` is already installed. If not, refer to the [official documentation][npm-doc].

### 3. Deploy the React app

1. Commit and push any untracked files to the GitHub repository.

1. Build the app.

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   By executing the command above, the [`predeploy`][package-json-predeploy] and [`deploy`][package-json-deploy] scripts will run and the React app will be deployed. Internally, the `predeploy` script creates a distributable version of the app and the `build` script pushes the compiled app to a commit in the [`gh-pages`][gh-pages-branch] branch. The [`gh-pages`][gh-pages] package will deploy the application to the specified [URL][package-json-homepage] whenever the `npm run deploy` command is executed. A [GitHub workflow][github-action] will link the GitHub page with the source files in the `gh-pages` branch, and once it is completed, the deployed app with the newest changes will be reflected [here][live-website].

## Common Issues

### Broken Media Display

More than likely, images and/or videos will not render in the deployed site using common `src` linking:

```html
<img src="./images/img-1.jpg" />
```

Since the website is deployed under the [`homepage`][package-json-homepage] URL, it will not recognize the source file for the image or video using local pathing. To overcome this, follow the steps below to change all `src` linking, depending on the use case.

1. Diagnose the type of media.

   1. _Background Image_

      1. Open the `.css` file that imports an image with the `background-image` property.
      1. Change the format of the `url()` value.

         ```css
         * {
           background-image: url("https://diegobajetti.github.io/check-my-attendance/images/img-1.jpg");
         }
         ```

         > The `url()` value should follow this format: `https://{github_username}.github.io/{repo_name}/{file_path}`

   1. _Image/Video Tag_

      1. Open the `.html` file that utilizes the `<img/>` or `<video/>` tag.
      1. Change the format of the `src` attribute.

         ```html
         <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + "/images/img-1.jpg"} />
         ```

         > The `src` attribute's value should follow this format: `process.env.PUBLIC_URL + "/{file_path}"`

   Alternatively, run the following two commands to match the two cases above:

   ```sh
   cd $(git rev-parse --show-cdup)/src
   ```

   ```sh
   grep -RIlxP --include=\*.{html,css,js} '^.*\b(?:src=|background\-image:).*$'
   ```

   `grep` is a utility for searching strings through multiple text files. Here, it is invoked with the following parameters:

   - `R` — reads all files under each directory, recursively, across all symbolic links
   - `I` — ignore binary files; process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data
   - `l` — print the name of each file for which a match was found
   - `x` — select only those matches that exactly match the whole line
   - `P` — interpret patterns as Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCREs)
   - `--include=` — search only files whose base name matches the pattern
   - Regex — find an explanation for the regular expression [here][regex-example]

1. Push these changes to the remote repository and [deploy](#3-deploy-the-react-app) the application. The global `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` variable allows for the images to be displayed when running locally _and_ when being deployed to the remote.

### Blank Page

Upon opening the deployed GitHub Pages site, the page might be blank until refreshing the browser. Follow the steps below to fix this.

1. Identify any `BrowserRouter` tags in the codebase.

1. Add the following property.

   ```html
   basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}
   ```

   Alternatively, run the following command to identify and replace the property.

   ```sh
   grep -RIl --include=\*.js '<BrowserRouter' | xargs sed -i 's/<BrowserRouter/<BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/g'
   ```

Specifying the `basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}` in the routing root allows the router to extract the base URL of the project and properly display the site.
